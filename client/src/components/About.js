    const blurb = "With a background in nutrition and biomedical research, exposure to powerful data analysis software sparked an interest in programming that stuck with me indefinitely. As the first tech of a novel research lab and ultimately the expert workhorse of a rapidly growing group, I was promoted to lab manager after six months. This experience equipped me to problem solve, develop solutions, and lead and teach others, even in an unfamiliar context. Iâ€™m excited to see where my background coupled with experience in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript based programming will take me."
